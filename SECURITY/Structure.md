                               # - `gosec`: Security AST scanner checking for hardcoded keys and SQL injection.
                               # - `govet`: Catches struct copy-locks and shadow variables.
                               # - `noctx`: Blocks HTTP requests sent without a lifecycle Context.
                               # - `nilnil`: Outlaws returning `nil, nil` to prevent silent app panics.
